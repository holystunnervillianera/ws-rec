# Phase 3: Autonomous AI Workforce Platform - TODO

## Project Overview
Build a self-managing autonomous platform with 7 specialized AI agents, natural language command center, and secure URL-based access. All agents orchestrated through Management Agent, with direct communication to user on request.

## Agent Framework & Architecture
- [x] Design agent communication protocol (message queue, event bus)
- [x] Create base Agent class with lifecycle management
- [x] Implement agent state management and persistence
- [x] Build agent registry and discovery system
- [x] Create agent-to-agent communication layer
- [x] Implement Management Agent orchestration logic
- [x] Build direct communication channel to user (bypass Management Agent)
- [x] Create agent capability matrix and permission system

## Core Agents Implementation
- [x] Management Agent - Coordinates all agents, reports to user
- [x] Trend Predictor Agent - Monitors social media, identifies viral opportunities
- [x] Content Creator Agent - Generates marketing materials, blog posts, social content
- [x] Sales Agent - Lead generation, outreach, conversion optimization
- [x] Operations Agent - Workflow automation, task management
- [x] Strategy Agent - Business intelligence, analytics, planning
- [x] Advanced Coder Agent - Maintains platform, configures models, updates code
- [x] Platform Architect Agent - Customizes specs, creates forms, manages integrations
